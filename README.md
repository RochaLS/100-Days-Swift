# 100-Days-Swift
100 days of Swift challenge!

## Project 1: Storm Viewer ‚úÖ
A basic picture viewer, using NavigationController, UITableViewController, FileManager, UIImage, and UIImageView.
This project was a good refresher of basic iOS and Swift concepts like optionals, tableViews and how to pass data between different View Controllers.

**Improvements:** Added rightBarButtonItem that allows users to share a text outside the app (ie: in social medias) recommending the app.


## Project 2: Flag Game ‚úÖ
A very simple multiple choice game, using different flags from different countries. It was a very good refresher on how basic Auto Layout, using UIAlertController and generating random numbers.

**Improvements:** Added rightBarButtonItem that when tapped shows the user their current score.

## Project 3: Storm Viewer Improvement (AKA Sharing app data outside the app) ‚úÖ
Improved the Storm Viewer project allowing users to share image and text outside the app (ie: in social medias) using UIActivityViewController. Using #Selector to trigger function.

## Milestone Project (1 - 3): Flag Viewer ‚úÖ üèÜ
Used all the knowledge learned from projects 1 - 3 and built this mini app from scratch.

## Project 4: Simple Web Browser ‚úÖ
Learned and implemented a simple web browser using WebKit, UIToolBar, URL and URL request. I had a little refresher about KVO(Key-Value Observing). This was a very fun challenge. 

## Project 5: Word Scramble ‚úÖ
Create a mini word scramble game where the user needs find anagrams from the given word. This project was a very good refresher to me about inserting rows at a UITableView. Learned accepting input from a textfield inside Alert Controller, and how to check text for misspelling using UITextChecker. Reviewed important concepts about closures and capture lists.

## Project 6a/b: Advanced Auto Layout ‚úÖ
This small projects were a good refresher on different ways to use Auto Layout. Visual Format Language can be very useful and powerful, but it's not that readable. On the other side Auto Layout Anchors are very readable and powerful too, in my opinion the most effective way to add set up constraints depending of the project. The IB is very powerful tool and it allow us to visualize our layout beforehand.

## Milestone Project (4 - 6): Shopping List ‚úÖ üèÜ
Used all the knowlegde acquired from projects 4 - 6 and built a basic shopping list app that allows users to add items, clear the whole list and share items added outside the app (ie: sharing on email). I was able to practice and improve my skills on closures, capture lists, tableViews, UIAlertControllers, toolbarItems and ActivityViewControllers.
